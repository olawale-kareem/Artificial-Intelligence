Reinforcement Learning
 - An agent takes action on an environment, its state is uttered based on the actions as a reward.

Bellman eqaution
    Richard Ernest bellman came with the concept of dynamic programming which is now has the bellman Equation.

    research paper: The theory of dynamic programming 1954

    - s -> state
    - a -> action
    - R -> reward
    - γ -> Discount

    V(s) = max(R(s,a) + γV(s^1))

    S^1 - the value of the previous state
